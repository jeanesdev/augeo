# Specification Quality Checklist: Event Creation and Management

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: October 19, 2025  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED

All checklist items have been validated and passed. The specification is complete and ready for the planning phase.

### Clarifications Addressed

Three clarifications were identified and resolved during specification creation:

1. **Event Slug/URL Generation**: Auto-generated from event name with manual override option
2. **Food Options Data Structure**: Free-text field for menu/dietary info in MVP, structured options deferred to future phase
3. **Media File Size Limits**: 10MB per file, 50MB total per event

These decisions are documented in the Clarifications section of the spec and align with MVP principles (simple first, enhance later).

## Notes

- Specification successfully integrates Event Coordinator persona needs (tablet-friendly, <15min setup)
- Domain model alignment confirmed (Event entity with relationships to Organization, Auction, EventMedia)
- Dependencies on specs 001 (Auth) and 002 (NPO Creation) are clearly documented
- Out of scope items properly categorized into Phase 2, Phase 3, and Not Planned
- Security requirements align with GDPR and file upload best practices
