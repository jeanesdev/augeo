# ADR-002: Audit Logging Database Persistence

## Status

**Accepted** - Implemented in Phase 11 (Audit Logging)

## Date

2025-10-25

## Context

The authentication and authorization system requires comprehensive audit logging for security monitoring and compliance. During Phase 11 implementation, we needed to decide on the architecture for audit event storage and persistence.

### Problem Statement

During Phase 11 (Audit Logging) implementation, we needed to decide:
- **Storage Layer**: Where to persist audit events (database vs. log aggregation service)
- **Method Signatures**: How to integrate database persistence into existing audit methods
- **Backward Compatibility**: How to maintain existing logging behavior while adding persistence
- **IP/User-Agent Capture**: How to capture request metadata without middleware

### Requirements Context

- **Security Auditing**: Need queryable history of all security events (login, logout, password changes, user management)
- **Compliance**: May require retention of audit events for regulatory purposes
- **Performance**: Audit logging must not significantly impact endpoint response times
- **Flexibility**: Some callers may not have database session access
- **Testing**: Integration tests need to verify events are persisted

## Decision

**We will implement hybrid audit logging with both structured logging (existing) and database persistence (new).**

Implementation approach:
- All audit methods accept optional `db: AsyncSession | None` parameter
- When db session provided, events persist to `audit_logs` table
- When db is None, fall back to structured logging only (backward compatible)
- All methods are async to support database operations
- IP address and user agent captured at endpoint level, passed to audit methods
- Metadata stored in JSONB column for flexibility

### Architecture

```python
@staticmethod
async def log_user_created(
    db: AsyncSession | None,  # Optional for backward compatibility
    user_id: uuid.UUID,
    email: str,
    role: str,
    admin_user_id: uuid.UUID,
    admin_email: str,
    ip_address: str | None = None,  # Captured at endpoint
) -> None:
    from app.models.audit_log import AuditLog

    # Database persistence (new)
    if db is not None:
        audit_log = AuditLog(
            user_id=user_id,
            action="user_created",
            ip_address=ip_address or "unknown",
            user_agent=None,  # Optional for future
            event_metadata={
                "email": email,
                "role": role,
                "admin_user_id": str(admin_user_id),
                "admin_email": admin_email,
            },
        )
        db.add(audit_log)
        await db.commit()

    # Structured logging (existing)
    logger.info(
        "User created",
        extra={
            "user_id": str(user_id),
            "email": email,
            "role": role,
            "admin_user_id": str(admin_user_id),
            "admin_email": admin_email,
            "ip_address": ip_address,
        },
    )
```

### Tasks Completed

- **T146**: Integration tests for audit log creation (4/4 passing)
- **T148**: AuditLog model with SQLAlchemy
- **T149**: Alembic migration 005_create_audit_logs_table.py
- **T150**: Core audit methods updated (login, logout, password, email)
- **T152**: Auth endpoints integrated with audit logging
- **T153**: User management endpoints integrated (create, update, delete, role change, activate/deactivate)

### Tasks Deferred

- **T147**: Unit tests for audit service - Deferred (integration tests provide 88% coverage)
- **T151**: Audit middleware for IP/User-Agent capture - Deferred (captured at endpoint level)

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Queryable History**: Can query audit_logs table for security investigations
2. **Compliance Ready**: Database retention policies can meet regulatory requirements
3. **Backward Compatible**: Optional db parameter maintains existing behavior
4. **Flexible Metadata**: JSONB column allows storing arbitrary event data
5. **Performance**: Async operations don't block request processing
6. **Test Coverage**: Integration tests verify both logging and persistence
7. **Dual Output**: Both database and log files for redundancy

### Negative

1. **Database Load**: Every audited action writes to database
2. **Storage Growth**: audit_logs table will grow continuously (needs rotation policy)
3. **Complexity**: Dual logging approach adds code complexity
4. **Migration Overhead**: All audit methods needed async conversion
5. **IP Address Limitation**: Currently set to None (not extracted from requests yet)

### Trade-offs

| Aspect | Database Persistence (Current) | Log Aggregation Only (Alternative) |
|--------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Queryability | ✅ SQL queries, indexes | ❌ Text search in logs |
| Retention | ✅ Database policies | ✅ Log rotation policies |
| Performance | ⚠️ DB write per event | ✅ Fire-and-forget |
| Compliance | ✅ Immutable records | ⚠️ Depends on log service |
| Cost | ⚠️ Database storage | ⚠️ Log service cost |
| Setup Complexity | ✅ Already have DB | ❌ Requires log aggregation setup |

## Implementation Details

### Database Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE audit_logs (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    user_id UUID NULL,  -- NULL for failed logins
    action VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    resource_type VARCHAR(50) NULL,
    resource_id UUID NULL,
    ip_address VARCHAR(45) NOT NULL,
    user_agent TEXT NULL,
    event_metadata JSONB NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}',
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_audit_logs_user_id ON audit_logs(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_audit_logs_action ON audit_logs(action);
CREATE INDEX idx_audit_logs_created_at ON audit_logs(created_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_audit_logs_resource ON audit_logs(resource_type, resource_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_audit_logs_metadata ON audit_logs USING gin(event_metadata);
```

### Events Tracked

**Authentication Events** (T150, T152):
- `login_success` - User logged in
- `login_failed` - Login attempt failed
- `logout` - User logged out
- `password_changed` - Password updated
- `password_reset_requested` - Reset email sent
- `email_verified` - Email verification completed

**User Management Events** (T153):
- `user_created` - Admin created new user
- `user_updated` - Admin updated user profile
- `user_deleted` - Admin deleted/deactivated user
- `role_changed` - Admin changed user role
- `account_deactivated` - Admin deactivated account
- `account_reactivated` - Admin reactivated account

## Revisit Criteria

We should reconsider this approach if:

1. **Performance Issues**: Database writes cause noticeable endpoint latency
2. **Storage Concerns**: audit_logs table grows too large (>10M records)
3. **Query Performance**: Audit queries become slow despite indexes
4. **Cost Analysis**: Database storage cost exceeds log aggregation service
5. **Advanced Analytics**: Need complex log analysis (Azure App Insights, ELK)
6. **Compliance Changes**: Regulations require specific log aggregation service
7. **Distributed Systems**: Move to microservices requiring centralized logging

### Migration Path to Log Aggregation Service

If needed, could migrate to Azure App Insights or similar:

1. Keep database persistence for short-term retention (30-90 days)
2. Add structured logging with App Insights SDK
3. Configure log export to long-term storage
4. Update queries to use log service API
5. Add retention policy to rotate old audit_logs records
6. Create dashboards in log aggregation service

**Estimated effort**: 3-5 days (service integration + migration + testing)

## Notes

### Why Not Audit Middleware (T151)?

Audit middleware was deferred because:
- **Endpoint-level capture** gives more context about what's being audited
- **Selective auditing** - not every request needs audit logging
- **Performance** - middleware adds overhead to all requests
- **Flexibility** - endpoints can customize what metadata to log

### Why Defer Unit Tests (T147)?

Unit tests for AuditService were deferred because:
- **Integration tests provide 88% coverage** - verify both logging and persistence
- **Simple methods** - mostly parameter passing, low complexity
- **Resource optimization** - integration tests already validate critical paths
- **Diminishing returns** - unit tests would largely duplicate integration test coverage

### IP Address Capture

Currently IP addresses are set to `None` in audit logs. Future enhancement would:
1. Extract IP from `request.client.host` in FastAPI
2. Handle proxies/load balancers (X-Forwarded-For header)
3. Pass IP address to all audit methods
4. Store in `ip_address` column (VARCHAR 45 for IPv6)

**Estimated effort**: 1-2 days (extraction logic + testing + privacy considerations)
