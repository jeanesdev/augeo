## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Create Basic Event (Priority: P1)

Event Coordinators can create a new fundraising event with essential details (name, date, venue) so they can establish the event in the system and begin planning their fundraiser.

**Why this priority**: Core functionality that enables all other event-related features. Without this, no events can exist in the system. This represents the absolute minimum viable event creation flow.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by logging in as an Event Coordinator, creating an event with required fields, and verifying the event appears in the event list with correct details.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an Event Coordinator is logged in and associated with an approved NPO, **When** they navigate to create event and enter event name, date, and venue, **Then** the event is created in draft status and they are redirected to the event dashboard
2. **Given** an Event Coordinator is creating an event, **When** they enter a date in the past, **Then** they receive a validation error and cannot proceed
3. **Given** an Event Coordinator creates an event, **When** the event is saved, **Then** a unique URL slug is auto-generated from the event name (e.g., "Spring Gala 2025" → "/events/spring-gala-2025")
4. **Given** an Event Coordinator is on the event creation form, **When** they leave required fields empty and attempt to submit, **Then** they see clear validation messages for each missing field

---

### User Story 2 - Event Branding and Visual Identity (Priority: P2)

Event Coordinators can customize their event's visual appearance with logos, colors, and branding so that the event page matches their gala's theme and creates a professional, cohesive experience for donors.

**Why this priority**: Critical for donor engagement and trust. Personas show that professional presentation directly impacts donor confidence. Can be tested independently once basic event creation exists.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating an event, uploading a logo and setting brand colors, then viewing the event page to verify branding is applied correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an Event Coordinator is editing an event, **When** they upload an event logo (PNG/JPG/SVG under 10MB), **Then** the logo is stored and displayed on the event page
2. **Given** an Event Coordinator is configuring event branding, **When** they select primary and secondary brand colors using a color picker, **Then** the event page reflects these colors in its design
3. **Given** an event has no custom logo uploaded, **When** donors view the event page, **Then** they see the NPO's logo as the default
4. **Given** an Event Coordinator uploads multiple media files, **When** the total exceeds 50MB, **Then** they receive a clear error message and cannot upload additional files until space is freed

---

### User Story 3 - Event Details and Descriptions (Priority: P2)

Event Coordinators can provide comprehensive event information including descriptions, food options, and logistical details so that donors have all the information they need to plan their attendance.

**Why this priority**: Essential for donor experience but not blocking event creation. Event Coordinators need this to communicate event details effectively.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating an event, adding detailed descriptions and food information, then viewing the event page to verify all content displays correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an Event Coordinator is editing an event, **When** they add a rich-text event description with formatting, **Then** the description is saved and rendered with proper formatting on the event page
2. **Given** an Event Coordinator is adding event details, **When** they create multiple food/menu options (e.g., "Chicken", "Vegetarian", "Vegan"), **Then** these options are available for donors to select during event registration
3. **Given** an Event Coordinator updates event venue or date, **When** they save changes, **Then** the updated information is immediately reflected on the public event page
4. **Given** an event has multiple sections of information (description, venue, food options), **When** donors view the event page, **Then** all sections are clearly organized and easy to read

---

### User Story 4 - Media Gallery and External Links (Priority: P3)

Event Coordinators can upload promotional materials (flyers, photos) and link to external content (videos, websites, social media) so they can build excitement and provide comprehensive event information to potential attendees.

**Why this priority**: Enhances marketing and donor engagement but not critical for core event functionality. Can be added after basic event creation and branding are stable.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by uploading multiple images, adding video links and social media tags, then verifying they display correctly on the event page.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an Event Coordinator is editing an event, **When** they upload multiple images (flyers, venue photos), **Then** the images are organized in a gallery on the event page
2. **Given** an Event Coordinator is adding media, **When** they paste a YouTube or Vimeo video URL, **Then** the video is embedded and playable on the event page
3. **Given** an Event Coordinator is configuring event promotion, **When** they add social media tags (hashtags, handles), **Then** these are displayed on the event page and included in shareable content
4. **Given** an Event Coordinator adds external website links, **When** they save the event, **Then** the links are validated as proper URLs and displayed with clear labels
5. **Given** an Event Coordinator has uploaded media files, **When** they want to remove or replace a file, **Then** they can delete or replace individual files without affecting others

---

### User Story 5 - Event Editing and Status Management (Priority: P2)

Event Coordinators can edit event details after creation and manage event status (draft, active, closed) so they can refine event information as plans evolve and control when the event is visible to donors.

**Why this priority**: Critical for iterative event planning workflow. Event Coordinators rarely get everything perfect on first creation and need flexibility to adjust.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating an event, making various edits, changing status, and verifying all changes persist and affect event visibility appropriately.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an Event Coordinator has created an event in draft status, **When** they are ready to launch, **Then** they can change the status to "active" and the event becomes visible to donors
2. **Given** an Event Coordinator is editing an active event, **When** they make changes and save, **Then** changes are reflected immediately on the public event page
3. **Given** an event is in active status, **When** the Event Coordinator changes it to draft, **Then** the event becomes invisible to donors but remains accessible to event staff
4. **Given** an event's scheduled end time is reached, **When** the Event Coordinator or NPO Admin is notified, **Then** they can manually close the event or allow automatic closure after 24 hours
5. **Given** an Event Coordinator is editing an event, **When** they navigate away without saving, **Then** they receive a warning about unsaved changes

### Edge Cases

**Event Creation Edge Cases**:
- What happens when two events have names that would generate identical URL slugs?
- How does the system handle event creation if the NPO is not yet approved?
- What occurs when an Event Coordinator tries to create an event without being associated with any NPO?
- How does the system respond when a user tries to create an event for an NPO they don't have coordinator access to?

**Media Upload Edge Cases**:
- What happens when a file upload fails mid-transfer?
- How does the system handle unsupported file types?
- What occurs when a user uploads a file with special characters or very long filenames?
- How does the system respond when attempting to upload a file that appears valid but is corrupted?

**Date and Time Edge Cases**:
- What happens when creating an event with a date in a different timezone?
- How does the system handle daylight saving time transitions for event dates?
- What occurs when an event spans multiple days?
- How does the system respond when the event date is changed to a date in the past after initial creation?

**Status Management Edge Cases**:
- What happens when an active event with registered donors is changed to draft status?
- How does the system handle closing an event that has active auctions or pending bids?
- What occurs when multiple coordinators try to edit the same event simultaneously? (System uses optimistic locking with last-write-wins; second saver receives conflict warning showing what changed)
- How does the system respond when an event is deleted while donors are viewing it?

**External Link Edge Cases**:
- What happens when a linked video is removed from YouTube/Vimeo?
- How does the system validate malformed or suspicious URLs?
- What occurs when social media handles contain invalid characters?
- How does the system display links when external sites are unreachable?
