# Feature Specification: User Authentication & Role Management

**Feature Branch**: `001-user-authentication-role`
**Created**: October 18, 2025
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "User Authentication & Role Management"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-18

- Q: What specific roles should the system start with and what are their core permissions? â†’ A: Multi-tier structure with Super Admin (Augeo staff), NPO Admin (full NPO access), Event Coordinator (event management), Staff (registration/checkin), and Donor (bidding only)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - User Registration & Login (Priority: P1)

New users can create accounts and existing users can securely access the system with their credentials. This establishes the foundation for all authenticated interactions within the platform.

**Why this priority**: Essential foundation for any user-based system. Without authentication, no other features can function securely. Represents the minimum viable authentication system.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a new account, logging out, and logging back in. Delivers immediate value by securing access to the platform.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a new user visits the registration page, **When** they provide valid email and password, **Then** they receive a confirmation email and can access their account
2. **Given** an existing user is at the login page, **When** they enter correct credentials, **Then** they are redirected to their dashboard
3. **Given** a user enters incorrect credentials, **When** they attempt to login, **Then** they receive an error message and cannot access the system
4. **Given** a user is logged in, **When** they click logout, **Then** their session is terminated and they are redirected to the login page

---

### User Story 2 - Password Recovery & Security (Priority: P2)

Users can recover access to their accounts when they forget their passwords and manage their account security settings.

**Why this priority**: Critical for user retention and support cost reduction. Users frequently forget passwords, and without recovery options, they abandon accounts.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by initiating password reset flow, receiving reset email, and successfully changing password to regain access.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user forgot their password, **When** they request a password reset, **Then** they receive a secure reset link via email
2. **Given** a user clicks a valid reset link, **When** they enter a new password, **Then** their password is updated and they can login with the new credentials
3. **Given** a user is logged in, **When** they change their password in settings, **Then** their password is updated and they remain logged in
4. **Given** a reset link is older than 1 hour, **When** a user tries to use it, **Then** they receive an error message indicating the link has expired

---

### User Story 3 - Role Assignment & Permission Management (Priority: P3)

Administrators can assign roles to users and manage what actions different user types can perform within the system.

**Why this priority**: Enables scalable user management and proper access control. Not needed for basic functionality but essential for multi-user environments.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating different roles, assigning them to users, and verifying that users can only access features appropriate to their role.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an administrator views the user management page, **When** they assign a role to a user, **Then** that user gains the permissions associated with that role
2. **Given** a user has a specific role, **When** they attempt to access a feature, **Then** they can only access features their role permits
3. **Given** an administrator creates a new role, **When** they define its permissions, **Then** users assigned to that role inherit those specific permissions
4. **Given** a user's role is changed, **When** they refresh their session, **Then** their access permissions update immediately

---

### User Story 4 - Session Management & Security (Priority: P4)

The system manages user sessions securely, including automatic logout for inactive sessions and detection of suspicious login attempts.

**Why this priority**: Enhances security and user experience but not essential for core functionality. Can be added once basic authentication is stable.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by remaining idle until session expires, logging in from multiple devices, and attempting rapid failed login attempts.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is inactive for 30 minutes, **When** they try to perform an action, **Then** they are prompted to re-authenticate
2. **Given** a user logs in from a new device, **When** they access their account, **Then** they receive a notification about the new login
3. **Given** multiple failed login attempts from the same IP, **When** the threshold is exceeded, **Then** that IP is temporarily blocked
4. **Given** a user is logged in on multiple devices, **When** they logout from one device, **Then** they remain logged in on other devices

### Edge Cases

**Registration & Login Edge Cases**:
- What happens when a user tries to register with an email that already exists?
- How does the system handle concurrent login attempts from the same account?
- What occurs when a user submits a registration form with invalid email format?
- How does the system respond to password reset requests for non-existent accounts?

**Role Management Edge Cases**:
- What occurs when an administrator tries to remove their own admin role?
- How does the system respond when a user's role is deleted while they're actively using the system?
- What happens when attempting to assign a non-existent role to a user?
- How does the system handle role assignments for users who are currently logged in?

**System & Infrastructure Edge Cases**:
- What happens when password reset emails fail to deliver?
- How does the system behave when the session storage becomes unavailable?
- What occurs during database connection failures during authentication?
- How does the system handle timezone differences for session expiration?

**Security Edge Cases**:
- What happens when multiple rapid password reset requests are made for the same account?
- How does the system respond to login attempts after account deletion?
- What occurs when session tokens are manually tampered with or corrupted?

- Users are familiar with standard authentication patterns (email/password, password reset flows)
- The system will primarily serve fundraising auction events for nonprofit organizations
- NPO administrators are trusted with user management responsibilities within their organization
- Event coordinators are trusted with event-specific user management and auction setup
- Session duration of 30 minutes of inactivity is appropriate for event-based usage patterns

- Multi-factor authentication (SMS, authenticator apps, hardware tokens)
- Advanced password policies (complexity rules, password history, expiration)
- Account lockout policies and brute force protection
- Email verification requirements for new accounts

**Phase 3 (Enterprise Features)**:
- Single Sign-On (SSO) integration with SAML/OIDC providers
- Active Directory/LDAP integration
- Advanced audit logging and compliance reporting
- Role hierarchy and inherited permissions
- API key management for service accounts

**Not Planned**:
