# Tasks: User Authentication & Role Management

**Input**: Design documents from `.specify/specs/001-user-authentication-role/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md ‚úÖ, spec.md ‚úÖ, research.md ‚úÖ, data-model.md ‚úÖ, contracts/ ‚úÖ

**Tests**: Tests are included as this is a security-critical feature requiring comprehensive validation.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
Based on plan.md: Web application structure with `backend/` and `frontend/` directories.

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - FOUNDATION FOR ALL OTHER STORIES
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Requires US1 complete (needs User, AuthService)
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Requires US1 complete (needs User, auth middleware)
- **User Story 4 (P4)**: Requires US1 complete (needs login/logout flows)

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Models before services
- Services before endpoints
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Once US1 is complete, US2, US3, US4 can be worked on in parallel (with caution on shared files)
- Email Verification (Phase 7) and Audit Logging (Phase 11) can run in parallel with user stories
- All Polish tasks marked [P] can run in parallel

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together:
Task T023: "Contract test for POST /api/v1/auth/register"
Task T024: "Contract test for POST /api/v1/auth/login"
Task T025: "Contract test for POST /api/v1/auth/logout"
Task T026: "Integration test for registration ‚Üí login flow"
Task T027: "Unit test for JWT token creation/verification"
Task T028: "Unit test for password hashing"

# After tests fail, launch all models together:
Task T029: "Create User model"
Task T031: "Create Session model"

# Launch all frontend components together:
Task T045: "Create login form component"
Task T046: "Create registration form component"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T011)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T012-T022) - CRITICAL - blocks all stories
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T023-T050)
4. Complete Phase 10: Super Admin Bootstrap (T142-T145) - needed for first admin
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently using quickstart.md
6. Deploy/demo if ready - Users can register, login, logout

### Incremental Delivery (Recommended)

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready (T001-T022)
2. Add Super Admin Bootstrap (T142-T145) ‚Üí First admin created
3. Add User Story 1 (T023-T050) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP! ‚úÖ)
4. Add User Story 2 (T051-T068) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Password recovery ‚úÖ)
5. Add Email Verification (T107-T120) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Email verified users ‚úÖ)
6. Add User Story 3 (T069-T092) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Role management ‚úÖ)
7. Add Audit Logging (T146-T153) ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Security audit trail ‚úÖ)
8. Add User Story 4 (T093-T106) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Session management ‚úÖ)
9. Add Event Staff (T121-T133) ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Event-scoped staff ‚úÖ)
10. Add RLS (T134-T141) ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Database-level isolation ‚úÖ)
11. Add Polish (T154-T170) ‚Üí Final production-ready release ‚úÖ

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together (T001-T022)
2. Team completes Super Admin Bootstrap (T142-T145)
3. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (T023-T050)
   - Developer B: Audit Logging (T146-T153) - runs parallel
4. Once US1 is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 2 (T051-T068)
   - Developer B: Email Verification (T107-T120)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (T069-T092)
5. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Tests are REQUIRED for this security-critical feature
- Follow quickstart.md for local development setup
- Use data-model.md for database schema reference
- Use contracts/ for API endpoint specifications
- Use research.md for architecture decisions

**Status**: Ready for implementation
**Next Step**: Begin Phase 1 (Setup) ‚Üí T001
**Version**: 1.0.0
