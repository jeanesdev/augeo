# Tasks: NPO Creation and Management

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-npo-creation/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/npo-management-api.yaml

**Tests**: Tests are included and REQUIRED per constitution (production-grade quality)

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4, US5)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Backend**: `backend/app/` (following existing structure)
- **Frontend**: `frontend/augeo-admin/src/`
- **Tests**: `backend/app/tests/` and `frontend/augeo-admin/tests/`

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 0)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 1)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 2-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order: US1 ‚Üí US2 ‚Üí US3 (MVP) ‚Üí US4 ‚Üí US5
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational - Independent (NPO creation)
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational - Independent (Branding, uses NPO ID from US1 but testable separately)
- **User Story 3 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational - Independent (Invitations, requires approved NPO but testable with mock)
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational - Independent (Approval workflow, integrates US1 but testable separately)
- **User Story 5 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational - Independent (Legal agreements, gates US4 but testable separately)

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Models before services
- Services before endpoints
- Backend before frontend (API-first)
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Phase 0**: T002, T003, T004, T005 can run in parallel
- **Phase 1**: T008-T013 (models), T016-T019 (schemas), T024-T025 (frontend setup) can run in parallel
- **Within each user story**: Test creation tasks can run in parallel
- **User Stories**: US1, US2, US3 can be worked on in parallel by different team members after Phase 1 completes

### MVP Definition

**Minimum Viable Product = Phase 0 + Phase 1 + Phase 2 + Phase 3 + Phase 4 (US1, US2, US3)**

This delivers:
- ‚úÖ NPO creation with full details
- ‚úÖ Branding customization with logo upload
- ‚úÖ Team invitation and collaboration
- ‚úÖ Multi-tenant data isolation
- ‚úÖ Role-based permissions

Can deploy and demo with these 3 user stories. US4 (approval) and US5 (legal) can be added in subsequent releases.

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (US1 + US2 + US3 Only)

1. Complete Phase 0: Setup
2. Complete Phase 1: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 2: User Story 1 (NPO creation)
4. Complete Phase 3: User Story 2 (Branding)
5. Complete Phase 4: User Story 3 (Invitations)
6. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test all 3 stories independently
7. Deploy MVP to staging for demo

### Full Feature Delivery

1. Complete MVP (US1 + US2 + US3)
2. Add Phase 5: User Story 4 (SuperAdmin approval) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy
3. Add Phase 6: User Story 5 (Legal agreements) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy
4. Complete Phase 7: Polish and documentation
5. Production deployment with full feature set

### Parallel Team Strategy

With 3 developers:

1. **Week 1**: All developers work on Phase 0 + Phase 1 together
2. **Week 2**: Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (NPO creation)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Branding)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (Invitations)
3. **Week 3**: Integration and testing:
   - Developer A: User Story 4 (Approval workflow)
   - Developer B: User Story 5 (Legal agreements)
   - Developer C: Phase 7 (Polish and testing)
4. Each story completes independently then integrates

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies - safe to parallelize
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- All tests must fail before implementation begins
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Follow existing patterns in backend/app/ for consistency
- Use existing authentication/audit infrastructure
- Azure Blob Storage required for logo uploads (US2)
- Email service required for invitations (US3)
