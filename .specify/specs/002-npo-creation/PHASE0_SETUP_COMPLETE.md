# Phase 0 Setup - Complete ✅

**Feature**: NPO Creation and Management (002-npo-creation)
**Date**: October 31, 2025
**Status**: All 5 tasks completed

## Summary

Phase 0 (Setup) has been successfully completed. All infrastructure configuration and dependencies needed for NPO management feature development have been established.

## Completed Tasks

### T001: Review Existing Authentication and Multi-Tenant Patterns ✅

**Findings**:
- ✅ **OAuth2/JWT Authentication**: Fully implemented with 15-min access tokens and 7-day refresh tokens
- ✅ **Multi-Tenant Architecture**: Uses `npo_id` field in User model for tenant isolation
- ✅ **Role-Based Access Control**: 5 roles implemented (super_admin, npo_admin, event_coordinator, staff, donor)
- ✅ **PostgreSQL RLS**: Row-Level Security policies documented for tenant isolation
- ✅ **Redis Session Management**: Active sessions stored in Redis with PostgreSQL audit trail
- ✅ **Permission Service**: Centralized authorization via dependency injection
- ✅ **Audit Logging**: All authentication events tracked

**Key Files Reviewed**:
- `backend/app/models/user.py` - User model with role_id and npo_id
- `backend/app/models/role.py` - Role entity with 5 role types
- `backend/app/middleware/auth.py` - JWT token validation and user extraction
- `backend/app/core/security.py` - JWT token creation and decoding
- `backend/app/core/config.py` - Application settings

**NPO-Specific Patterns to Leverage**:
- User model already has `npo_id` field for NPO association
- Role-based middleware can be extended for NPO Admin and Co-Admin roles
- Existing audit logging can capture NPO creation/modification events

### T002: Setup Azure Blob Storage Container ✅

**Actions Taken**:
- ✅ Added Azure Blob Storage configuration to `backend/.env.example`:
  - `AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING`
  - `AZURE_STORAGE_CONTAINER_NAME=npo-assets`
  - `AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME`

- ✅ Updated `backend/app/core/config.py` with new settings:
  ```python
  azure_storage_connection_string: str | None = None
  azure_storage_container_name: str = "npo-assets"
  azure_storage_account_name: str | None = None
  ```

**Next Steps** (for deployment):
1. Create Azure Storage account: `augeoplatform` (or similar)
2. Create blob container: `npo-assets` with private access
3. Configure CORS for client-side uploads
4. Generate connection string and update `.env`
5. Enable CDN for logo serving (optional, Phase 2)

**Local Development Note**:
- Connection string is optional for local dev
- File upload service will need mock for testing without Azure

### T003: Configure Email Service Credentials ✅

**Status**: Already configured ✅

**Existing Configuration**:
- Azure Communication Services email already set up in `backend/.env.example`
- Email service implemented in `backend/app/services/email_service.py`
- Email templates can be added for NPO invitation notifications

**For NPO Feature**:
- Will reuse existing email infrastructure
- New email templates needed:
  - NPO invitation email (with JWT token link)
  - Application status update email (approved/rejected)
  - Welcome email on NPO approval

### T004: Add Python Dependencies to pyproject.toml ✅

**Dependencies Added**:
```toml
pillow = "^10.0.0"                # Image processing and validation
python-magic = "^0.4.27"          # File type detection
azure-storage-blob = "^12.19.0"   # Azure Blob Storage integration
pydantic-extra-types = "^2.0.0"   # Enhanced validation (emails, URLs)
```

**Purpose**:
- **Pillow**: Image validation, resizing, format conversion for NPO logos
- **python-magic**: MIME type detection for file upload security
- **azure-storage-blob**: Direct Azure Blob Storage integration for signed URLs
- **pydantic-extra-types**: Advanced validators for social media URLs, phone numbers

**Installation Command**:
```bash
cd backend && poetry install
```

### T005: Add Frontend Dependencies to package.json ✅

**Dependencies Added**:
```json
"react-colorful": "^5.6.1",     // Color picker for branding
"react-dropzone": "^14.3.5"     // Drag-and-drop file upload
```

**Purpose**:
- **react-colorful**: Lightweight color picker for NPO primary/secondary colors
- **react-dropzone**: File upload with drag-and-drop for logo upload
- **@tanstack/react-query**: Already present for server state management

**Installation Command**:
```bash
cd frontend/augeo-admin && pnpm install
```

## Configuration Files Updated

### Backend
- ✅ `backend/.env.example` - Added Azure Blob Storage variables
- ✅ `backend/app/core/config.py` - Added storage configuration settings
