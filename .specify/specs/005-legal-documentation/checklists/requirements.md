- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Assessment

✅ **PASS** - No implementation details found. Specification focuses on user-facing functionality and legal requirements without mentioning specific technologies, frameworks, or code structure.

✅ **PASS** - Focused on user value and business needs. Requirements center on legal compliance, user consent management, and regulatory adherence (GDPR, CCPA, EU Cookie Law).

✅ **PASS** - Written for non-technical stakeholders. Language is clear and focused on business requirements and user experience rather than technical implementation.

✅ **PASS** - All mandatory sections completed: User Scenarios & Testing, Requirements, and Success Criteria are all present and comprehensive.

### Requirement Completeness Assessment

✅ **PASS** - No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present. All requirements are defined with sufficient clarity based on standard legal compliance practices.

✅ **PASS** - Requirements are testable and unambiguous. Each functional requirement (FR-001 through FR-031) defines clear, verifiable behavior.

✅ **PASS** - Success criteria are measurable. All success criteria (SC-001 through SC-010) include specific metrics such as percentages (100%), time limits (2 seconds, 30 seconds), and click counts.

✅ **PASS** - Success criteria are technology-agnostic. Criteria focus on user outcomes (e.g., "Users can customize cookie preferences in under 30 seconds") without referencing implementation technologies.

✅ **PASS** - All acceptance scenarios are defined. Each user story includes multiple Given-When-Then scenarios covering normal flows and variations.

✅ **PASS** - Edge cases are identified. Six edge cases are documented covering scenarios like popup dismissal, version mismatches, consent withdrawal, and jurisdiction handling.

✅ **PASS** - Scope is clearly bounded. Feature focuses specifically on legal documentation (Terms, Privacy Policy, Cookie Consent) and associated consent management without scope creep.

✅ **PASS** - Dependencies and assumptions identified. Requirements reference regulatory frameworks (GDPR, CCPA, EU Cookie Law) and standard compliance practices.

### Feature Readiness Assessment

✅ **PASS** - All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria through the user story acceptance scenarios.

✅ **PASS** - User scenarios cover primary flows: document acceptance during registration (P1), cookie consent (P1), document access (P2), and consent history (P3).

✅ **PASS** - Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria. All 10 success criteria provide clear targets for feature validation.

✅ **PASS** - No implementation details leak into specification. Requirements remain focused on what needs to be achieved, not how to implement it.

## Notes

All validation items passed successfully. The specification is complete, clear, and ready for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).

**Assumptions Made**:

- Cookie consent follows EU Cookie Law standards (strictest global requirement)
- Privacy Policy consent follows GDPR requirements (strictest data protection regulation)
- Consent retention period of 7 years follows standard legal archival practices
- Cookie preference storage duration of 12 months follows common industry practice
- Three cookie categories (Essential, Analytics, Marketing) represent minimum compliance standard

**Regulatory Context**:

- GDPR (EU): Requires explicit consent, right to access, right to erasure, data portability
- CCPA (California): Requires privacy notice and opt-out mechanisms
- EU Cookie Law: Requires explicit consent before non-essential cookies
- These requirements meet the strictest global standards and will satisfy most jurisdictions
