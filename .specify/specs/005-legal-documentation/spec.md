# Feature Specification: Legal Documentation & Compliance

**Feature Branch**: `005-legal-documentation`
**Created**: 2025-10-28
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Legal Documentation: I need to add Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, and a cookie consent pop up to my app."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - View and Accept Terms of Service (Priority: P1)

New users must review and accept the Terms of Service before using the platform. This establishes the legal agreement between the platform and users.

**Why this priority**: Legally required before users can access any platform features. Without this, the platform operates without user agreement to terms.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by registering a new account and verifying that Terms of Service must be accepted before account activation. Delivers legal compliance and user agreement.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a new user is registering, **When** they submit the registration form, **Then** they must be presented with Terms of Service that require explicit acceptance
2. **Given** a user has not accepted the Terms of Service, **When** they attempt to access platform features, **Then** they are blocked until acceptance is provided
3. **Given** a user views the Terms of Service, **When** they read the content, **Then** they can see the last updated date and version number
4. **Given** a user accepts the Terms of Service, **When** the acceptance is recorded, **Then** the system logs the timestamp, version accepted, and user identifier

---

### User Story 2 - View and Accept Privacy Policy (Priority: P1)

Users must be informed about how their personal data is collected, used, stored, and protected. They must provide explicit consent before data processing begins.

**Why this priority**: Required for GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy regulations. Users cannot legally use the platform without being informed of data practices.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by registering a new account and verifying that Privacy Policy must be reviewed and accepted. Delivers regulatory compliance for data processing.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a new user is registering, **When** they are presented with legal documents, **Then** the Privacy Policy must be displayed alongside Terms of Service
2. **Given** a user views the Privacy Policy, **When** they read the content, **Then** they can see details about data collection, usage, retention, and their rights
3. **Given** a user accepts the Privacy Policy, **When** the acceptance is recorded, **Then** the system logs consent timestamp, version accepted, and consent scope
4. **Given** an existing user's Privacy Policy was updated, **When** they next log in, **Then** they must review and accept the updated version before proceeding

---

### User Story 3 - Cookie Consent Management (Priority: P1)

Users must be informed about cookies and tracking technologies used on the platform and provide granular consent before non-essential cookies are set.

**Why this priority**: EU Cookie Law and GDPR require explicit consent for non-essential cookies before they are placed on user devices.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by visiting the platform in a new browser session and verifying the cookie consent popup appears before any non-essential cookies are set. Delivers cookie compliance.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user visits the platform for the first time, **When** the page loads, **Then** a cookie consent popup appears before any non-essential cookies are set
2. **Given** the cookie consent popup is displayed, **When** the user views it, **Then** they can see categories of cookies (essential, analytics, marketing) with descriptions
3. **Given** a user reviews cookie options, **When** they make their selection, **Then** they can accept all, reject all, or customize by category
4. **Given** a user accepts or rejects cookies, **When** their choice is recorded, **Then** only cookies matching their consent are activated
5. **Given** a user has previously set cookie preferences, **When** they return to the platform, **Then** their preferences are respected and the popup does not reappear
6. **Given** a user wants to change cookie preferences, **When** they access settings, **Then** they can modify their choices at any time

---

### User Story 4 - Access Legal Documents Anytime (Priority: P2)

Users must be able to review Terms of Service and Privacy Policy at any time after accepting them, without requiring re-acceptance unless content has changed.

**Why this priority**: Legal requirement to provide access to governing documents. Users may need to review policies when making decisions about platform use.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by logging in as an existing user and navigating to legal documents from footer links. Delivers transparency and user empowerment.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is logged into the platform, **When** they navigate to the footer, **Then** they can see links to "Terms of Service" and "Privacy Policy"
2. **Given** a user clicks on a legal document link, **When** the page loads, **Then** they can view the full current version without requiring re-acceptance
3. **Given** a user is viewing a legal document, **When** they read it, **Then** they can see version history and effective dates

---

### User Story 5 - View Consent History and Data Rights (Priority: P3)

Users should be able to view their consent history (what they accepted and when) and exercise their data rights as required by privacy regulations.

**Why this priority**: GDPR Article 7 requires proof of consent. Users have the right to withdraw consent and access their data. While important, this can be added after initial legal compliance is achieved.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by logging in and navigating to privacy settings to view consent history. Delivers full GDPR compliance and user control.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user accesses their account settings, **When** they navigate to privacy settings, **Then** they can view a history of their consents (Terms, Privacy Policy, Cookies)
2. **Given** a user views consent history, **When** they review entries, **Then** they can see what was accepted, when, and which version
3. **Given** a user wants to withdraw consent, **When** they select that option, **Then** they are informed of the consequences (e.g., account closure may be required)
4. **Given** a user exercises data rights, **When** they request data export or deletion, **Then** the system provides appropriate workflows

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user closes the cookie consent popup without making a choice? (Assume reject all non-essential cookies)
- How does the system handle users who accepted old versions of Terms/Privacy Policy? (Require re-acceptance on next login)
- What happens if a user tries to withdraw consent for Terms of Service? (Account must be deactivated or deleted)
- How does the system handle cookie consent for users browsing from different jurisdictions? (Display appropriate popup based on jurisdiction requirements)
- What happens when Terms or Privacy Policy are updated while a user is actively using the platform? (Notify on next page navigation or session renewal)
- How does the system track cookie consent for anonymous users before account creation? (Store consent in browser storage, transfer to account upon registration)
