# Tasks: Legal Documentation & Compliance

**Input**: Design documents from `.specify/specs/005-legal-documentation/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/api-contracts.md, quickstart.md

**Tests**: Tests are NOT explicitly requested in the specification, so test tasks are EXCLUDED per instructions.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

Based on plan.md: Web application with `backend/` and `frontend/augeo-admin/` structure

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - US1 (P1), US2 (P1), US3 (P1) can proceed in parallel after Phase 2
  - US4 (P2) depends on US1 and US2 (needs legal documents infrastructure)
  - US5 (P3) depends on US1, US2, US3 (needs consent tracking infrastructure)
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories ‚úÖ
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories ‚úÖ
- **User Story 3 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories ‚úÖ
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Integrates with US1/US2 but independently testable
- **User Story 5 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Uses infrastructure from US1/US2/US3 but independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Backend endpoints before frontend integration
- Models and services (from Foundational) already complete
- API clients before components
- Zustand stores before components that use them
- Components before page integration
- Core implementation before optimization

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: T002-T006 (database tables) can run in parallel
- **Phase 2 (Foundational)**: T010-T013 (models), T015-T017 (schemas) can run in parallel
- **Phase 3 (US1)**: T027-T028 (types), T029-T030 (services), T032-T033 (hooks), T034-T035 (components) can run in parallel within their groups
- **Phase 4 (US2)**: T042 (modal) can run parallel with T043-T044 (integration)
- **Phase 5 (US3)**: T052-T053 (types/service), T055-T056 (hook/utils), T057-T058 (components) can run in parallel within their groups
- **Phase 6 (US4)**: T066-T067 (pages), T062-T065 (backend endpoints with caching) can run in parallel
- **Phase 7 (US5)**: T079-T080 (components), T071-T078 (backend endpoints) can run in parallel
- **Phase 8 (Polish)**: T084-T086 (admin endpoints), T088-T091 (optimization), T092-T094 (docs), T096-T100 (security) can run in parallel

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all backend endpoints for User Story 1 together:
Task T021: "GET /api/v1/legal/documents/terms_of_service endpoint"
Task T022: "POST /api/v1/consent/accept endpoint"
Task T023: "GET /api/v1/consent/status endpoint"

# Launch all frontend types/services for User Story 1 together:
Task T027: "LegalDocument types"
Task T028: "Consent types"
Task T029: "legalService API client"
Task T030: "consentService API client"

# Launch all frontend hooks for User Story 1 together:

Task T033: "useConsentCheck hook"

# Launch all frontend components for User Story 1 together:
Task T034: "LegalDocumentViewer component"
Task T035: "TermsOfServiceModal component"
```

# Services run sequentially (depend on models/schemas):
Task T018: "LegalService"
Task T019: "ConsentService"
Task T020: "CookieService"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1, 2, 3 - P1 Priority)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (database schema)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (models, schemas, services) - **CRITICAL BLOCKER**
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (TOS acceptance)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (Privacy Policy acceptance)
5. Complete Phase 5: User Story 3 (Cookie consent)
6. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test P1 stories independently
7. Deploy MVP with basic legal compliance

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready (T001-T020)
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí MVP-1 (T021-T037)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí MVP-2 (T038-T044)
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí MVP-3 (T045-T061) **Production Ready**
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Enhanced (T062-T070)
6. Add User Story 5 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Full GDPR Compliance (T071-T083)
7. Polish and optimize ‚Üí Final Release (T084-T100)

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. **Team completes Setup + Foundational together** (T001-T020) - **MUST COMPLETE FIRST**
2. **Once Foundational is done, split into parallel tracks**:
   - **Developer A**: User Story 1 (TOS) - T021-T037
   - **Developer B**: User Story 2 (Privacy) - T038-T044
   - **Developer C**: User Story 3 (Cookies) - T045-T061
3. **After P1 stories complete**:
   - **Developer A**: User Story 4 (Document Access) - T062-T070
   - **Developer B**: User Story 5 (Data Rights) - T071-T083
   - **Developer C**: Polish & Admin - T084-T100

### Recommended MVP Scope

**Minimum Viable Product** = Phase 1 + Phase 2 + Phase 3 + Phase 4 + Phase 5

This delivers:
- Terms of Service acceptance during registration ‚úÖ
- Privacy Policy acceptance during registration ‚úÖ
- Cookie consent popup with blocking ‚úÖ
- Basic GDPR compliance ‚úÖ
- ~61 tasks, estimated 2-3 weeks

**Extended MVP** = Add Phase 6 (Document Access)

- Footer links to legal documents ‚úÖ
- View documents without re-acceptance ‚úÖ
- ~70 tasks, estimated 3 weeks

**Full Feature** = All phases (1-8)

- Complete GDPR compliance with data rights ‚úÖ
- Admin document management ‚úÖ
- Full optimization and security ‚úÖ
- ~100 tasks, estimated 4-5 weeks

---

## Task Count Summary

- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: 9 tasks
- **Phase 2 (Foundational)**: 11 tasks (BLOCKING)
- **Phase 3 (US1 - TOS)**: 17 tasks
- **Phase 4 (US2 - Privacy)**: 7 tasks
- **Phase 5 (US3 - Cookies)**: 17 tasks
- **Phase 6 (US4 - Access)**: 9 tasks
- **Phase 7 (US5 - Data Rights)**: 13 tasks
- **Phase 8 (Polish)**: 17 tasks

**Total**: 100 tasks

**Parallel Opportunities**: 37 tasks marked [P] can run in parallel with other tasks

**MVP Tasks** (Phase 1-5): 61 tasks
**Extended MVP** (Phase 1-6): 70 tasks
**Full Feature** (Phase 1-8): 100 tasks

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies, can run in parallel
- [US#] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Phase 2 (Foundational) is CRITICAL - blocks ALL user story work
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- All file paths are absolute and match plan.md structure
- Tests were NOT requested in specification, so test tasks are excluded
- Focus on implementation ‚Üí manual testing ‚Üí iteration based on spec acceptance scenarios
