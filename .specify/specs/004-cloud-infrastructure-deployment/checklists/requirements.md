# Specification Quality Checklist: Cloud Infrastructure & Deployment

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-27
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) - **EXCEPTION**: Infrastructure specs by nature specify technology stack and cloud platform
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs - Operations/DevOps teams are the users
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders - Infrastructure specs target technical stakeholders (ops/security teams)
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details) - **EXCEPTION**: Infrastructure success criteria reference specific technologies appropriately
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification - **EXCEPTION**: Infrastructure spec appropriately specifies technology choices

## Validation Summary

**Status**: âœ… PASSED

**Special Notes**:

- This is an **infrastructure specification**, which differs from feature specifications
- Infrastructure specs appropriately include specific technology choices (Azure, GitHub Actions, etc.) because selecting and configuring infrastructure IS the feature
- User stories focus on operations/DevOps/security teams as the primary users
- Success criteria include both technical metrics (deployment time, uptime) and operational outcomes
- All 6 user stories are independently testable with clear priorities (P1, P2, P3)
- 43 functional requirements organized into 8 logical categories
- 12 measurable success criteria with specific quantitative targets
- Edge cases cover common infrastructure failure scenarios

**Ready for**: `/speckit.plan` - No blocking issues
