# Feature Specification: Cloud Infrastructure & Deployment

**Feature Branch**: `004-cloud-infrastructure-deployment`
**Created**: 2025-10-27
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "004-cloud-infrastructure-deployment"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Platform Operations Team Deploys Application (Priority: P1)

The operations team needs to provision and configure all required Azure cloud resources to host the Augeo Platform backend and frontend applications in a production-ready environment with proper monitoring and security controls.

**Why this priority**: Without cloud infrastructure, the application cannot be deployed to production or accessed by real users. This is the foundation for all other deployment activities.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by provisioning Azure resources via Infrastructure as Code (Bicep/Terraform), deploying a "Hello World" version of the application, and verifying that services are accessible, monitored, and secured. Success delivers a working production environment ready for application deployment.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** Infrastructure as Code templates are prepared, **When** operations team executes deployment scripts, **Then** all Azure resources (App Service, PostgreSQL, Redis, Key Vault, Application Insights) are provisioned successfully with correct configurations
2. **Given** Azure resources are provisioned, **When** operations team reviews resource configuration, **Then** all resources use appropriate SKUs/tiers for production workloads and are configured with security best practices (network rules, TLS, managed identities)
3. **Given** Azure resources are provisioned, **When** operations team checks Application Insights, **Then** telemetry data flows from all services and monitoring dashboards display system health metrics
4. **Given** deployment completes, **When** operations team reviews cost analysis, **Then** actual monthly costs align with budgeted estimates (within 10% variance)

---

### User Story 2 - Development Team Implements CI/CD Pipeline (Priority: P1)

The development team needs automated CI/CD pipelines that build, test, and deploy both backend and frontend applications to multiple environments (dev, staging, production) with proper validation gates and rollback capabilities.

**Why this priority**: Automated deployments are essential for maintaining code quality, reducing deployment errors, and enabling rapid iteration. Manual deployments are error-prone and don't scale.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by committing code changes to a feature branch, watching GitHub Actions execute build/test/deploy workflows, and verifying that applications are automatically deployed to the correct environment with database migrations applied. Success delivers hands-free deployment capability.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** code changes are committed to a feature branch, **When** pull request is created, **Then** CI pipeline runs tests, linting, and security scans, reporting results as PR status checks
2. **Given** pull request is merged to main branch, **When** GitHub Actions workflow executes, **Then** backend application is built, tested, and deployed to staging environment automatically
3. **Given** backend deployment to staging succeeds, **When** GitHub Actions workflow continues, **Then** database migrations run via Alembic and frontend application deploys to staging environment
4. **Given** staging deployment completes successfully, **When** operations team manually approves production deployment, **Then** applications deploy to production environment with zero downtime using blue-green or rolling deployment strategy
5. **Given** production deployment encounters errors, **When** operations team triggers rollback, **Then** previous working version is restored within 5 minutes

### User Story 3 - Operations Team Configures Custom Domain & Email Services (Priority: P2)

The operations team needs to configure a custom domain with proper DNS records to provide branded URLs for the application and enable email sending through Azure Communication Services with full email authentication (SPF, DKIM, DMARC).

**Why this priority**: Custom domain provides professional branding and is required for production email sending. However, applications can initially deploy using Azure-provided URLs while domain configuration is completed.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by purchasing/configuring a domain (e.g., augeo.app), setting up Azure DNS, pointing domain records to Azure services, configuring Azure Communication Services with domain verification, and sending test emails. Success delivers fully functional branded URLs and email capability.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** domain is registered, **When** operations team configures Azure DNS, **Then** domain successfully points to frontend and backend services (e.g., admin.augeo.app, api.augeo.app) with SSL/TLS certificates auto-provisioned
2. **Given** Azure Communication Services is provisioned, **When** operations team adds custom domain, **Then** domain ownership is verified and email sending is enabled
3. **Given** email domain is configured, **When** operations team adds DNS records (SPF, DKIM, DMARC), **Then** email authentication tests pass with 100% deliverability score on mail-tester.com
4. **Given** email services are configured, **When** application sends verification emails, **Then** emails arrive in user inboxes (not spam) within 30 seconds with correct sender branding

### User Story 4 - Security Team Manages Secrets & Configuration (Priority: P2)

The security team needs centralized secrets management using Azure Key Vault to store sensitive credentials (database passwords, API keys, JWT secrets) with proper access controls and audit logging, ensuring no secrets are stored in source code or environment variables in plain text.

**Why this priority**: Proper secrets management is critical for security compliance and prevents credential leaks. However, initial deployments can use Azure App Service configuration settings while Key Vault integration is implemented.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by storing test secrets in Key Vault, configuring applications to retrieve secrets using managed identities, and verifying that applications function without hardcoded credentials. Success delivers secure credential management meeting security compliance requirements.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** Azure Key Vault is provisioned, **When** operations team stores database connection string and JWT secret, **Then** secrets are encrypted at rest and access is logged in audit trail
2. **Given** secrets are stored in Key Vault, **When** backend application starts, **Then** application retrieves secrets using managed identity without requiring passwords or access keys
3. **Given** application uses Key Vault secrets, **When** security team reviews deployment configuration, **Then** no secrets appear in source code, environment variables, or deployment logs
4. **Given** multiple environments exist (dev, staging, prod), **When** applications deploy, **Then** each environment retrieves environment-specific secrets from separate Key Vault instances

### User Story 5 - Operations Team Implements Backup & Disaster Recovery (Priority: P3)

The operations team needs automated backup strategies for PostgreSQL database and Redis cache with defined retention policies and tested disaster recovery procedures to ensure data can be restored in case of accidental deletion, corruption, or service failures.

**Why this priority**: Backups are essential for data protection but can be implemented after initial production launch. Azure provides default backup capabilities that can be enhanced with custom retention policies over time.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by configuring automated backups, simulating a disaster scenario (deleting test data), executing restore procedures, and verifying data recovery within defined RTO/RPO targets. Success delivers confidence in disaster recovery capabilities.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** PostgreSQL database is provisioned, **When** operations team enables automated backups, **Then** full backups run daily with point-in-time restore capability for 30 days
2. **Given** automated backups are configured, **When** operations team performs test restore, **Then** database is restored to a test environment within 1 hour with data integrity verified
3. **Given** Redis cache is provisioned, **When** operations team configures persistence, **Then** Redis data is persisted to Azure Storage with automatic backups every 4 hours
4. **Given** disaster recovery plan is documented, **When** operations team conducts quarterly DR drill, **Then** full system recovery completes within 4 hours (RTO) with maximum 15 minutes of data loss (RPO)

---

### User Story 6 - Development Team Monitors Application Health (Priority: P3)

The development and operations teams need comprehensive monitoring dashboards showing application performance metrics, error rates, and infrastructure health with automated alerting for critical issues enabling proactive incident response.

**Why this priority**: Monitoring is important for operational excellence but applications can launch with basic health checks and logging. Advanced monitoring and alerting can be enhanced iteratively based on operational experience.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by configuring Application Insights dashboards, simulating various application behaviors (normal traffic, errors, slow responses), and verifying that metrics are captured and alerts trigger appropriately. Success delivers visibility into application health and automated incident notification.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** Application Insights is configured, **When** users access the application, **Then** request telemetry, performance metrics, and dependency calls are captured and visualized in dashboards
2. **Given** monitoring dashboards are configured, **When** operations team views dashboards, **Then** key metrics display: request rate, response time (p50/p95/p99), error rate, CPU/memory usage, database query performance
3. **Given** alerting rules are configured, **When** error rate exceeds 5% for 5 minutes, **Then** alert notifications are sent to operations team via email and Microsoft Teams
4. **Given** application encounters exceptions, **When** operations team reviews Application Insights, **Then** full exception stack traces, request context, and user session details are available for debugging
