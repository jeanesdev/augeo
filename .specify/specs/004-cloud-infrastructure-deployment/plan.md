# Implementation Plan: Cloud Infrastructure & Deployment

**Branch**: `004-cloud-infrastructure-deployment` | **Date**: 2025-10-27 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/004-cloud-infrastructure-deployment/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Provision and configure complete Azure cloud infrastructure to host the Augeo Platform in a production-ready environment. Implement automated CI/CD pipelines for backend and frontend deployment across multiple environments (dev, staging, production) with proper security controls, monitoring, and disaster recovery capabilities. This infrastructure foundation enables real email sending, production deployment, and operational excellence for all current and future features.

## Technical Context

**Infrastructure as Code**: Azure Bicep (preferred) or Terraform
**Cloud Platform**: Microsoft Azure
**CI/CD**: GitHub Actions workflows
**Container Runtime**: Docker for backend/frontend packaging
**Backend Hosting**: Azure App Service (Linux container) - Standard S1+ SKU
**Frontend Hosting**: Azure Static Web Apps or App Service with CDN
**Database**: Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server - General Purpose (2 vCores, 8GB RAM)
**Cache**: Azure Cache for Redis - Standard C1 (1GB) with TLS and persistence
**Secrets Management**: Azure Key Vault with Managed Identity access
**Email Service**: Azure Communication Services with custom domain
**Monitoring**: Azure Application Insights + Log Analytics workspace
**DNS Management**: Azure DNS with automated SSL/TLS certificates
**Deployment Strategy**: Blue-green or rolling deployment with manual approval gates for production
**Backup Strategy**: Automated daily backups with 30-day retention, quarterly disaster recovery drills
**Performance Goals**: Infrastructure provisioning <30 min, CI/CD deployment <15 min, 99.9% uptime
**Constraints**: Cost optimization (appropriate SKUs), secrets never in source code, zero-downtime deployments
**Scale/Scope**: 3 environments (dev/staging/prod), 1000+ concurrent users, multi-region consideration for Phase 2

## Constitution Check

### Infrastructure & Technology Stack Alignment

✅ **Cloud Provider: Microsoft Azure** - Aligns with constitution requirement for Azure-managed services (PostgreSQL, Redis, Blob Storage, Key Vault, App Service)

✅ **Infrastructure as Code** - Bicep/Terraform meets constitution requirement for reproducible environments and version-controlled infrastructure

✅ **CI/CD with GitHub Actions** - Matches constitution specification for automated testing, building, and deployment workflows

✅ **Secrets Management via Azure Key Vault** - Enforces constitution's "never commit secrets" and "use Azure Key Vault" requirements

✅ **Monitoring with Application Insights** - Aligns with constitution's observability requirements (Prometheus metrics, structured logging, alerting)

### Security & Compliance

✅ **TLS Everywhere** - All Azure resources configured with TLS 1.2+, HTTPS only, automated certificate management

✅ **Network Security** - Private networking, NSGs, firewall rules restrict database/cache access to App Service only

✅ **Audit Logging** - Key Vault access logging, deployment audit trail, security event tracking

✅ **Backup & Disaster Recovery** - Daily automated backups (30-day retention), quarterly DR drills, documented RTO/RPO

### Development Workflow

✅ **Trunk-Based Development** - CI/CD pipeline integrates with main branch, staging validation, manual production approval gates

✅ **Zero-Downtime Deployments** - Blue-green or rolling deployment strategy with automated rollback capability

✅ **Cost Controls** - Azure Cost Management budgets, auto-scaling limits, resource tagging for tracking

### Performance & Reliability

✅ **Real-Time Reliability** - Infrastructure supports <500ms bid updates with Redis caching and optimized database configuration

✅ **Production-Grade Quality** - All infrastructure defined as code, peer-reviewed, tested in staging before production

✅ **Solo Developer Efficiency** - Leverages Azure managed services to avoid operational overhead (managed DB, Redis, monitoring)

### Gate Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - All constitution requirements satisfied

**No violations to justify** - This infrastructure specification directly implements the constitution's technology stack and operational requirements.

**Structure Decision**: This is an infrastructure feature that adds new top-level directories (`infrastructure/`, enhanced `.github/workflows/`) rather than modifying application code. The structure separates Infrastructure as Code templates, deployment scripts, CI/CD workflows, and operational documentation into logical groupings. Bicep is preferred over Terraform for tighter Azure integration, but both options are scaffolded for flexibility during research phase.

## Complexity Tracking

No constitution violations - infrastructure specification aligns with all constitutional requirements.
