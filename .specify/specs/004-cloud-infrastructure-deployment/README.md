# Spec 004: Cloud Infrastructure & Deployment

**Status**: ðŸ“‹ Planning (Not Started)
**Priority**: P2 (Required for Production Launch)
**Blocking**: Real email sending, production deployment
**Date Created**: 2025-10-25

## Overview

This spec will cover the complete cloud infrastructure setup and deployment strategy for the Augeo Platform, including:

- Azure resource provisioning and configuration
- Domain acquisition and DNS setup
- CI/CD pipeline implementation
- Environment management (dev, staging, production)
- Secrets and configuration management
- Monitoring, logging, and alerting
- Backup and disaster recovery strategy

## Why This Spec Exists

During Phase 11 (Audit Logging) completion, we identified that real email sending requires:
- Azure Communication Services with verified domain
- DNS configuration (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)
- Production URLs for email links
- Proper secrets management

Rather than implement email in isolation, this spec will handle **all infrastructure concerns holistically**.

## Scope

### Infrastructure Components
- [ ] Azure App Service (or Container Apps) for backend
- [ ] Azure Static Web Apps (or App Service) for frontend
- [ ] Azure Database for PostgreSQL (production tier)
- [ ] Azure Cache for Redis (production tier)
- [ ] Azure Communication Services (Email)
- [ ] Azure Key Vault (secrets management)
- [ ] Azure Application Insights (monitoring)
- [ ] Azure CDN (optional - for static assets)
- [ ] Azure Front Door (optional - for load balancing)

### Domain & DNS
- [ ] Domain acquisition/configuration (augeo.app or similar)
- [ ] DNS zone setup in Azure DNS
- [ ] SSL/TLS certificates (Let's Encrypt or Azure managed)
- [ ] Email DNS records (SPF, DKIM, DMARC, MX)
- [ ] Subdomain strategy (api.augeo.app, admin.augeo.app, etc.)

### Deployment & CI/CD
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflows for backend deployment
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflows for frontend deployment
- [ ] Environment-specific configurations (dev, staging, prod)
- [ ] Database migration strategy (Alembic in CI/CD)
- [ ] Rollback procedures
- [ ] Blue-green or canary deployment strategy

### Security & Compliance
- [ ] Secrets management (Key Vault integration)
- [ ] Environment variable strategy
- [ ] Network security groups
- [ ] CORS configuration for production
- [ ] Rate limiting configuration
- [ ] DDoS protection
- [ ] Backup strategy and retention policies

### Monitoring & Operations
- [ ] Application Insights integration
- [ ] Log Analytics workspace setup
- [ ] Alerting rules (errors, performance, availability)
- [ ] Dashboards for operations monitoring
- [ ] Cost monitoring and budgets

## Dependencies

**Blocks**:
- Real email sending (Azure Communication Services)
- Production deployment
- User acceptance testing in production-like environment

**Blocked By**:
- None - can start anytime

**Related Specs**:
- Spec 001: User Authentication & Role Management (needs production deployment)
- Spec 002: NPO Creation (will need same infrastructure)
- Spec 003: Event Creation (will need same infrastructure)

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All Azure resources provisioned via Infrastructure as Code (Bicep or Terraform)
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline successfully deploys backend and frontend
- [ ] Production environment accessible via custom domain
- [ ] Email sending works in production
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards show system health
- [ ] Secrets properly managed in Key Vault
- [ ] Database backups automated and tested
- [ ] Cost under $X/month (budget TBD)

## Documents to Create

When ready to start this spec:
- [ ] `plan.md` - Infrastructure architecture and deployment strategy
- [ ] `research.md` - Azure services evaluation, cost analysis, security review
- [ ] `infrastructure.md` - Azure resource specifications and configuration
- [ ] `deployment.md` - CI/CD pipeline design and deployment procedures
- [ ] `operations.md` - Monitoring, alerting, backup, and disaster recovery
- [ ] `tasks.md` - Step-by-step implementation tasks

## Estimated Effort

**Planning**: 2-3 days (research, architecture, cost estimation)
**Implementation**: 5-8 days (infrastructure setup, CI/CD, testing)
**Total**: ~2 weeks for complete production-ready infrastructure

## Notes

- This is a **cross-cutting concern** affecting all features
- Should be done **before production launch** but not blocking feature development
- Can use local Docker setup for development until this is complete
- Mock email mode sufficient for development and testing
