## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational phase - Infrastructure provisioning
- **User Story 2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on User Story 1 - Requires infrastructure to deploy to
- **User Story 3 (Phase 5)**: Can start after User Story 1 - Domain configuration is independent
- **User Story 4 (Phase 6)**: Can start after User Story 1 - Secrets management is independent
- **User Story 5 (Phase 7)**: Depends on User Story 1 - Requires database/Redis to be provisioned
- **User Story 6 (Phase 8)**: Can start after User Story 1 - Monitoring can be configured independently
- **Polish (Phase 9)**: Depends on all user stories - Final hardening

### User Story Dependencies

```text
Foundational (Phase 2)
    ‚Üì
US1: Infrastructure Provisioning (Phase 3) ‚Üê MUST complete first
    ‚Üì
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí US2: CI/CD Pipeline (Phase 4) ‚Üê Requires infrastructure
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí US3: Custom Domain (Phase 5) ‚Üê Independent after US1
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí US4: Secrets Management (Phase 6) ‚Üê Independent after US1
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí US5: Backup & DR (Phase 7) ‚Üê Requires database/Redis from US1
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚Üí US6: Monitoring (Phase 8) ‚Üê Independent after US1
```

### Critical Path

1. **Setup (Phase 1)** ‚Üí 2. **Foundational (Phase 2)** ‚Üí 3. **US1: Infrastructure (Phase 3)** ‚Üí 4. **US2: CI/CD (Phase 4)**

This critical path enables automated deployments. Other user stories (US3-US6) enhance the infrastructure but aren't blocking for basic deployment capability.

### Parallel Opportunities

**Within Setup Phase**:

- T006, T007, T008 can all run in parallel

**Within Foundational Phase**:

- T010, T011 can run in parallel after T009
- T014 can run in parallel with Bicep development

**Within User Story 1 (Infrastructure)**:

- T018-T026: All Bicep modules can be developed in parallel (9 parallel tasks)
- T027-T029: All environment parameters can be created in parallel

**Within User Story 2 (CI/CD)**:

- T038-T040: All workflow files can be created in parallel
- T042-T044: All deployment scripts can be created in parallel
- T046-T048: All configuration files can be created in parallel

**Within User Story 3 (Domain/Email)**:

- T061, T062: Bicep modules can be developed in parallel

**Within User Story 6 (Monitoring)**:

- T121, T122: Application instrumentation can be done in parallel
- T126-T131: Alert rules can be configured in parallel
- T133-T136: Dashboards/workbooks can be created in parallel
- T138-T140: Availability tests can be configured in parallel

**Cross-Story Parallelism** (after US1 completes):

- US3, US4, US6 can all proceed in parallel (independent of each other)
- US5 depends on US1 but can run in parallel with US3, US4, US6
- US2 should complete before production deployment, but can overlap with US3-US6

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 (Infrastructure Modules)

```bash
# Launch all Bicep module development in parallel:
Task T018: "Create App Service Plan module at /infrastructure/bicep/modules/app-service-plan.bicep"
Task T019: "Create App Service (Backend) module at /infrastructure/bicep/modules/app-service.bicep"
Task T020: "Create Static Web App (Frontend) module at /infrastructure/bicep/modules/static-web-app.bicep"
Task T021: "Create PostgreSQL Flexible Server module at /infrastructure/bicep/modules/database.bicep"
Task T022: "Create Azure Cache for Redis module at /infrastructure/bicep/modules/redis.bicep"
Task T023: "Create Key Vault module at /infrastructure/bicep/modules/key-vault.bicep"
Task T024: "Create Application Insights module at /infrastructure/bicep/modules/monitoring.bicep"
Task T025: "Create Log Analytics Workspace module at /infrastructure/bicep/modules/log-analytics.bicep"
Task T026: "Create Storage Account module at /infrastructure/bicep/modules/storage.bicep"

# Result: 9 modules completed simultaneously instead of sequentially
```

**Phase 8: Advanced Monitoring** (27 tasks)

- Dashboards and alerting
- Proactive incident response
- **DELIVERABLE**: Operational excellence

**Phase 9: Polish** (17 tasks)

- Cost optimization
- Final hardening
- **DELIVERABLE**: Production-ready platform

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple team members:

**Week 1**: Everyone together

- Complete Setup (Phase 1)
- Complete Foundational (Phase 2)

**Week 2**: After Foundational phase done

- **Engineer A**: User Story 1 (Infrastructure) - 20 tasks
  - Develop all Bicep modules
  - Create parameters for all environments
  - Deploy to dev

**Week 3**: After US1 infrastructure deployed

- **Engineer A**: User Story 2 (CI/CD) - 22 tasks
- **Engineer B**: User Story 4 (Secrets) - 19 tasks (in parallel)
- **Engineer C**: User Story 6 (Monitoring) - 27 tasks (in parallel)

**Week 4**: Production readiness

- **Engineer A**: User Story 3 (Domain/Email) - 24 tasks
- **Engineer B**: User Story 5 (Backup/DR) - 17 tasks (in parallel)
- **Everyone**: Polish and production deployment (Phase 9)

## Notes

- Infrastructure tasks focus on IaC templates, workflows, and operational docs (not application code)
- Each user story delivers independently testable infrastructure capability
- Bicep chosen over Terraform per research decision (can swap if needed)
- `[P]` tasks = different files/resources, can develop in parallel
- `[Story]` label maps task to acceptance criteria in spec.md
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate infrastructure independently
- Production deployment should happen after US1-US4 complete (foundational + security)
