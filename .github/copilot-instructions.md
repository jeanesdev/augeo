# augeo-platform Development Guidelines

Auto-generated from all feature plans. Last updated: 2025-10-19

## Active Technologies
- Python 3.11+ (Backend), TypeScript (Frontend) + FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Pydantic, React, Zustand (002-npo-creation)

## Project Structure
```
src/
tests/
```

## Commands

### Backend (Python)
**CRITICAL**: Always use Poetry for Python commands. Never use pip, venv, or virtualenv directly.

- Run tests: `cd backend && poetry run pytest`
- Run linter: `cd backend && poetry run ruff check .`
- Run formatter: `cd backend && poetry run black .`
- Install dependencies: `cd backend && poetry install`
- Add package: `cd backend && poetry add <package>`
- Run any Python command: `cd backend && poetry run <command>`

### Frontend
- Install: `pnpm install`
- Dev server: `pnpm dev`
- Build: `pnpm build`
- Test: `pnpm test`

## Development Environment

### Python Environment
- **Package Manager**: Poetry (ALWAYS use `poetry run` for all Python commands)
- **Virtual Environment**: Managed by Poetry at `~/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs/`
- **Never use**: pip install, venv/bin/activate, python -m commands directly
- **Always use**: `poetry run python`, `poetry run pytest`, etc.

## Code Style
Python 3.11+ (Backend), TypeScript (Frontend): Follow standard conventions

## Git Workflow

### Committing Changes
**CRITICAL**: Always use the safe-commit script to ensure pre-commit hooks pass before committing.

**Always use**:
```bash
./scripts/safe-commit.sh "your commit message"
```

**Never use**:
```bash
git commit -m "message"  # ‚ùå Don't use - bypasses pre-commit verification
```

**Why**: The safe-commit script:
- Runs pre-commit hooks to completion
- Auto-stages formatting changes (ruff, black, trailing whitespace, etc.)
- Re-runs hooks after auto-fixes to verify
- Only commits if all checks pass
- Prevents failed commits that need re-doing

**If you must commit manually** (for testing or special cases):
```bash
git add -A
pre-commit run --all-files
# If changes were made, re-stage and re-run:
git add -A
pre-commit run --all-files
# Then commit:
git commit -m "message"
```
